plan the project

test mode 
user =====> Route:/, page: Test =======> TlDraw

Realtime mode                          config/WhiteBoard
user==> Route:/realtime, page: Realtime ================> TlDraw ==> sync server

collaborate mode                           WhiteBoard
user==> Route:/realtime, page: Realtime ================> TlDraw =====>(save/load <=> BAAS DB )


API VS SDK
API - Application Program Interface
it's just way to communicate frontend with backend work as a middleware/ middleman

SDK : 
Software Development Kit - it's like a bundle

it contains -
             Features
             libraries
             documentations etc

no duplication just pass me configuration i will provide you shameless experience



here we need to use TlDraw SDK


BAAS = Backend as a service
firebase
supabase
appwrite


react Router
